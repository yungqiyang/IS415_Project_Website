# **Project Overview:**

Singapore is a developed nation, yet some citizens feel that certain areas are still inconvenient to live in, as evident through the variable demand of certain housing areas.

Our group has decided to contribute to the study of accessibility/convenience (or lack thereof) in certain areas in Singapore by providing interested users with a visualisation and data analysis tool into the level of amenities available across Singapore.

**Modules included:**

-   Modeling Geographic Of Accessibility

-   Hotspot analysis using the accessibility score for each region

-   Geospatial clustering patterns of amenities
