title: "IS415 Project: Geospatial Analysis and Applications"
---

# **Project Overview:**

Singapore is a developed nation, yet some citizens claim that certain areas are still inconvenient to live in, as evident through the demand of certain housing areas.

Our group has decided to study if there is indeed a lack of accessibility/convenience in certain areas in Singapore.

The desired goal of this project is to potentially suggest areas for improvement to the Singapore government

**Analysis to be done:**

-   Modeling Geographic Of Accessibility

-   Hotspot analysis using the accessibility score for each region

-   Geospatial clustering patterns of amenities
